What I Learned:
I went from having literally no coding experience to having my own portfolio. I learned about Python and Object Oriented Programming. I learned about Flask and developing web-applications. I learned about SQLAlchemy and SQLite to access databases.
I even learned a little bit about HTML and CSS! Doing this TechDegree has been a blast and I look forward to being able to do this for a living!
